== Frequently Asked Questions ==

- How to change the copyright message in the footer?
Finedine is a free theme, so the theme designer's copyright information is needed. You can change it by copying footer.php from the parent theme to your child theme folder and edit it. This way the changes you make will not be replaced during the future updates to the theme.
